# this file is for the dodotronic ultrasonic microphone. 
# model 200kHz (they do a 250kHz too, I think)
# It looks like this in /proc/asound/cards
# ----------------------------------------
#  2 [bits           ]: USB-Audio - UltraMic 200K 16 bits
#                      DODOTRONIC Technology   . UltraMic 200K 16 bits at usb-0000:00:1a.0-1.1, full s
#-----------------------------------------
# and this in lsusb:
# Bus 001 Device 008: ID 0869:0301  
# with no description.

# at 192kHz, datarate is 2x192000 bytes per second = 384,000 bytes / sec
# second.  An audio buffer of 10 seconds, will occupy 3.8M which is fine.

# so set up te variables:
SAMPLERATE="-r192000"
CHANNELS="-c1"
MMAP=""
ABUFFER=" --buffer-time=10000000 "  # 10 second of buffer
AUDIODEVICE="-Dhw:bits"

# amixer $AUDIODEVICE 

log "prepare_mic: AUDIODEVICE=$AUDIODEVICE SAMPLERATE=$SAMPLERATE CHANNELS=$CHANNELS ABUFFER=$ABUFFER MMAP=$MMAP"
