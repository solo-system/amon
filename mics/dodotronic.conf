# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTES on supporting dodotronic soundcards/microphones:

# we don't use the alsa "plug" functionality for the dodotronic mics.
# I make the assumption that the user wants the FASTEST possible sample rate.

# Laptop shows this for dodotronic 384k:
# 2 [r0             ]: USB-Audio - UltraMic384K 16bit r0
#                      DODOTRONIC Technology UltraMic384K 16bit r0 at usb-0000:00:14.0-3, full speed
		       
# and the 304k has the following controls:



# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Below: older notes from pre 2019.

# model 200kHz (they do a 250kHz too, I think)
# It looks like this in /proc/asound/cards
# ----------------------------------------
#  2 [bits           ]: USB-Audio - UltraMic 200K 16 bits
#                      DODOTRONIC Technology   . UltraMic 200K 16 bits at usb-0000:00:1a.0-1.1, full s
#-----------------------------------------
# and this in lsusb:
# Bus 001 Device 008: ID 0869:0301  
# with no description.

# at 192kHz, datarate is 2x192000 bytes per second = 384,000 bytes / sec
# second.  An audio buffer of 10 seconds, will occupy 3.8M which is fine.

# The dodotronic says 200kHz on the box.  It's usb device name declares it's a 200kHz device.
# yet if you try to arecord from it at 200kHz, it baulks:
# arecord: main:617: bad speed value 200000
# so you HAVE to specify -r192000 on the arecord command line.
# However, arecord seems to quickly notice that it infact is communicating at 200kHz, and duly
# puts 200kHz in the 44-byte wav header of the output .wav file.

# this is odd, but we've worked around it.
# SAMPLERATE="-r200000" # this doesn't work!!! (see above)

# TODO: should check that the recorded audio is indeed actually at
# 200kHz, by checking using a known frequency generator..

# The "bits" name turns out to be unreliable, as a user reports their
# dodotronic 200k identifies itself as "r4". Therefore pick the card
# num and stream num from the path of the micdescription file (eg:
# /proc/asound/card1/stream0)
