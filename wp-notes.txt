add hexdump to amon.
Also put lencheck - which takes: file length, a and 2 hexcumps and validates they are all consistent,
Also put lenfix - which fixes the 2 numbers inside the riff wave to be consistent with the file length.

My new solo this morning started with :
 2018-08-01_06-33-08: [amon[633]->main]: INFO: No statefile "/mnt/sdcard/amondata/logs/amon.state" - creating one ...
 2018-08-01_06-33-08: [amon[633]->main]: Creating statefile: amon MASTERSWITCH is "on"

TODO: run the headless (networkless) solo with a calendar+witty to see if time stuff works without network.

capturing sub-commands is hard to log.  Do we need a exelog() command that achieves it in amon?

hexdump "recent" | logcatter

function exelog() {
	 shift
	 cmd="$*"
	 log "about to run and capture cmd=\"$cmd\""
	 ls -l /etc/ | whle read line ; do
	   log "$line"
	 done
	   
Should we change watchdogs to halt/pause/exit if solo-boot.sh hasn't stopped.  THEY could at least report that solo-boot.sh.started was unaccompanied by i's friend .finished?

Does it support witty pi 1?

/var/lib/apt/lists contins a 60M "Packages", and various less big ones.  And an inRelease file (small).  Find the apt cache clean command that gets rid of all this guff.  Or do it by hand.

Deal with "we got an RBT from the calendar, but there is no witty pi.  Warning".

add better led flash code, so the heartbeat happens only when we are actually recording (or the red light flashes than).

also add "amon witty wittypi status" and "amon wittypi setrrbt XXX XXX" (and others?)

Also - we call "stop" somwerher, but should we not be calling "off".  Why do we not see solo's return from witty poweroff, and sit dumbly in the "off" position?.  AHA - it's _because_ we use stop.  But then _why_ does the calendar (withtout witty) not turn on again at first watchdog encounter?

With calendar: a stop will be "fixed" at next watchdog.
               a off  will never be recovered from (because statefile trumps calendar response).
Do we need to re-instate MASTERSWITCH in /boot/amon.conf?


arecord's -USR1 signal splits.  the Man page says that kill INTR ABRT AND (another?) close the output file and exit.  But it doesn't properly handle the wav header.  It's a shame, because the USR1 _does_ do this, and under harder circumstances (gotta keep recording, man).  maybe look at the code one day.

In the mean time, find a "sleep" number that gives us enough time to clean up, but not enough so that the new file is hefty enough to feel real.  Could either look at the code and fix (aplay.c) or could put in a line to "find the last file recorded and delete it if it's really small".  Remember, we can take time and cpu over this, as the machine isn't recording.  Actually, we could find the final file and FIX IT! (even better!).

But need a hex dump tool to read RIFF wav headers, as we don't have soxi, and it's too onerous to do this by hand copying to shub every time.

TODO: write a hexdump line to read wav headers.http://www.topherlee.com/software/pcm-tut-wavformat.html
      There are 2 places where the number of samples occurs (file length and data length).

amon off (and therefore amon stop?) leaves radgged header on file. WOW THIS NEEDS FIXED.

does dailyProvision end by printing a list of all files in / ?  It would be good to get a final list (uing find?) orderable by size?  MOTIVATION?: check that /var/log is empty.  Look: auth.log has 32k already (a fe hours).

always check cron.log for spurious output.  It's bedlam in there.

can we count reboots ?

GOAL: [For tonight]: run a 1 hour on, 1 hour off calendar.

line 691 of defs.sh - should do slightly better check that rbt only supplied for an "off" situation from the calendar.
tidy up the old calendar files with the new "IFS=S read" trick from wittypi people (avoid multiple calls to date).

amon look for solo-boot.started but NOT solo-boot.finished, and waits (or exits).

Documentation: 
  put some pointers and examples in solo.git/boot/solo.conf and solo.git/solo.conf for acceptable timezones.  Also update doc on githubpages.
  !!!Must put bluetack over the raspberry pi 's power socket!!!!

TODO: compare images with imgCompare:
   does amon stop leave ragged ends on wav files? (split doesn't.  TRUE - split doesn't)
   generally, what changes (system analysis, not just audio).
   syslog gets very long (but see the img in imgcompare.)

tidying up wp.sh <--> amon interface:
 what time format should we use to talk to each other:
   a. want users calendars to output "things sensible to the user".
   b. want to have a format within amon that we can "take 90 seconde off of" to account for boot time.
   c. need snooze protection - ensure we don't fall asleep again if we wake early.

 There's only a few things we need from wp.sh:
   - set the time
   - show the time.
   - prepare for shutdown (?)

Other questions:
   Why do cronjobs seem to cluster at boot time?  Are they buffered? or is it anacron or sumfink?
   can we glide over a reboot time set in the wittypi alarm, and just be up and stay up? (or should we keep zeroing that alarm?)

sort out the logging in wp.sh (it needs to be root (or does it), but
the output doesnt get into amon.log - that's not good enough. And I
don't want to TOO closely integrate witty pi stuff, as many (most)
people won't use it.  bring higher level functions into defs.sh (witty defs .sh?) starting wp-????() and use those to do logging and stuff, and they can call wp.sh for the low level stuff.  What groups do I need to be in to get rid of the sudo stuff?  (i2cdev/gpio)

as more and more reboots happen, does the boot get slower?  Is that a fsck on /mnt/sdcard issue? what is the systemd command to trace boot times etc...


Mon 30 Jul 2018
---------------
apt-get install -y wiringpi
git clone jdmc2@shub:git/amon 
echo "i2c-dev" >> /etc/modules (or sudo modprobe i2c-dev). Q: how should we leave the clock - as usual?  And expect wp.sh to unload and reload
 clock as it sees fit?  (is that load/unload loop corrupting?).

Sun 29 Jul 2018

NEXT: Take the new sosi.  Run it, 
      	       -- then look below at what's needed to get it running (grodon's gpio lib).
	       -- consider adding that stuff to the general build
	       -- make a new (internal) image with 200M of space.
	       Then start the dev cycle:
	       -- clone wpdev into /opt/git/amon2 (or sumfink).
	       -- get bounce to work.
	       -- edit the wp.sh file, to make it do anything new (just lumbering up...)
	       -- do the dev outlined below, and loop till it works.

??? move wittypi hardware over to model B (for audio and ethernet simultaneously).

make directory calendars/wp/
put a first25mins.sh calendar in there.  It returns 2 things on/off and time-of-restart (in local time).
./first25mins.sh
on xzulu
or...
off 22:00.

ok, that bounce complains if /dev/rtc0 is mounted.  So at the top of it, we should unmount it.

Developing on the pi:

Now want to do some dev work.  How to get git working...
How to dev on a pi:
  go to git repo on pi (/opt/git/amon  /opt/solo)
  chown it all (cos it's roots):
  sudo chown -R amon.amon amon/

Now on shub, make a dev branch:
  cd git/amon
  git branch wpdev
  <make a change and commit>

Now back on the pi, pull from that branch.
  git pull jdmc2@shub:git/amon wpdev (pulls from that branch).
  sudo make install (to copy amon etc to /home/amon/amon).

loop as needed.

mv the wp stuff in git/tbox/wp into this dev branch:


Fri 06 Jul 2018
---------------
set up back in Sheelynn.  Running:
rsync -av jdmc2@shub:git/tbox/wittypi .          # (to sync)
sudo ./wittypi/dev/wittyPi-dev3/wp.sh bounce     # to reboot in 1 minute
sudo ./wittypi/dev/wittyPi-dev3/wp.sh status     # to show next reboot time. (and check clocks)

Wed 27 Jun 2018
---------------
Set up in fingal now, with a repo within git/tbox that will do as a briefcase.
REM: need to install gpio, and do the modules stuff.

Now - the witty pi code is keen to keep the RTC umounted, becuse it
wants to bit-twiddle the registers of the clock.  Fair enough.  We
should let the witty pi software do this.  But it does mean that the
timedatectl (or whatever) it is that SETS the RTC initially (or sync's
it), will not be able to run, once the witty pi code has done
anything, because the clock will be gone.  timedatectl registers no
rtc, when it's unmounted, so clearly it won't set it after an NTP
grab.  This is ok, cos witty pi stuff will only ever be run if the
WITTYPI=yes is in the solo.conf file, and people won't do that when
they are setting the clock. (ensure docs make this clear).


Mon 25 Jun 2018
---------------
Did a test - it started after 2 days.  Yahoo.  I also did a battery change during that, (albeit a really quick one), and it still worked.

Also just tested the audio with the soundblaster2play, and it worked with no buzzing, which is a relief.

Set up a directory for development under dev here so won't lose code if sdcard corrupts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next time: it works - run the wittyPi.sh script to set a time, then choose hidden 9 to shutdown.  Yay it reboots.

How to integrate: use calendar infrastructure, and if calendar call returns off XXX then set reboot time to XXX and shutdown.
OR : use the witty pi stuff as is, and let users learn the witty pi format from the witty pi website.
(which works better ?  Particularly for those who DON't have a witty pi?).

Type "amon off", then type "sudo poweroff", and current draw drops to 26mW (0.0053A).
So - no it doesn't - the powerbank times out.  So moved the blue jumper "dummy load" to the "on" position.
Now, when I do "sudo poweroff" it goes down to 0mW, 24mW, 500mW (500 every 10 seconds, for a quick blip).  This keeps the powerbank alive.

Now need to see if I can get a "wake up at" thing going.  I hope for:

1) install bits from https://github.com/uugear/Witty-Pi-2/blob/master/installWittyPi.sh
   wget https://github.com/uugear/Witty-Pi-2/blob/master/installWittyPi.sh
   wget fails... so look at it in a browser...
   [dtparam stuff - I'm ignoring it.]
   [i2c-tools is already installed.]
   NEED: apt-get install -y wiringpi
   INSTALL wittypi stuff:
     wget http://www.uugear.com/repo/WittyPi2/LATEST -O wittyPi.zip
     unzip wittyPi.zip -d wittyPi
     sudo modprobe i2c-dev
     Need to add this to provision:
       echo "i2c-dev" >> /etc/modules (or on command line, from /boot/config.txt?)
2) find the "set wakeup time" bit of their code.
3) run it.
4) call poweroff.
5) wait for it to reboot.
And it did - once.  Then I "cleared all registers", and now it won't.  Grrr.
sudo i2cset -y 0x01 0x68 0x0E 0x05 (to enable alarm A - Startup alarm).
Nope that didn't work.

So I've hacked wittyPi.sh (the CLI) to have a secret option 9), which shutsdown now.  And it works.
Leaving it here for tonight - it works!!!


Older notes:
------------
Before doing this work:  Got these numbers from normal running solos.  The clac was really good.  The snowflake is ok, the SB3 is pisspoor.
snowflake=112mA, SB3=150mA, nousb-noclac=85mA, clac=85mA (same)

Notes from todo.txt:

Solo scheduler (with witty pi):
 compatible with existing calendars?
 does powerbank time out (and how does witty pi handle it).
 Problem: At shutdown time, need to set wakeup time.  How do I find "next" wakeuptime.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed 06 Jun 2018
---------------
booted a+ with "witty pi 2" on an ethernet dongle.

Noticed /dev/rtc0 detected as an DS1307 device.  And noticed "timedatectl", that rtc0 has been set from NTP and looks good.

All jumpers are in the "left" position.  Typed amon off to stop attempts to record audio.

What to do next? - get their software:

https://github.com/uugear/Witty-Pi-2/blob/master/installWittyPi.sh

does various things to initialise a raspbian system...  Looking through:
 installs wiringpi (from drogon), and then builds it.  ( I notice it's in apt-cache).
 installs wittypi2/LATEST from their own website.
 removes hw-clock-fake and other update-rc.d things.
 optionally installs QT5 (for some sort of GUI), which might be usable.

Goals:
	find out power usage when sleeping.
	fing out power usage when running (no diff?)
	but do the above with no ethernet connection (since it confuses power).
	 - install the power monitor now.
 	find the command that does "set wake time to 14:00", sleep - "sleepTill(wakeTime)"

	- does the power bank "time out". (what does the dummy load do).

	- find a way to get solo recording as soon as it boots (don't wait for first cron job).
	  - use a @boot entry in crontab?

        - get a red flash when recording is going (good for debug during witty-dev, and generally).
	  - get power readings with and without LED on.


Find a way for unsophisticated users to communicate their schedules to /boot/solo/wittypi/config.txt

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
LED experiments:
Turn both leds off:
root@solo:/sys/class/leds# echo default-on > led0/trigger
root@solo:/sys/class/leds# echo default-on > led1/trigger

with both on:  0.0769 mA (ethernet dongle is off, but going through witty pi2).
with both off: 0.0722 mA (diference of ~50mA)
